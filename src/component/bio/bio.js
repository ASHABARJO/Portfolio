          <p>Hello, I'm Asha Barjo, a recent graduate with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering. Technology enthusiast at heart, I have a strong foundation in programming, front-end development, machine learning, and design. Fluent in both English and Hindi, I thrive on effective communication and collaboration across diverse backgrounds. For me, practical experience is as crucial as theoretical knowledge. Recently, I completed a project where I crafted a responsive website with an intuitive user interface. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set; for instance, I've recently delved into an introductory course on Photoshop. With a firm belief in perseverance and hard work, I'm dedicated to pursuing my passion for technology and overcoming any challenges that come my way.</p>
